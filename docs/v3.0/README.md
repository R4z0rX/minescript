## In-game commands

### Command basics

Minescript commands are available from the in-game chat console. They’re
similar to Minecraft commands that start with a slash (`/`), but Minescript
commands start with a backslash (`\`) instead.

Python scripts in the **minescript** folder (within the **minecraft** folder)
can be run as commands from the in-game chat by placing a backslash (`\`)
before the script name and dropping the `.py` from the end of the filename.
E.g. a Python script `minecraft/minescript/build_fortress.py` can be run as a
Minescript command by entering `\build_fortress` in the in-game chat. If the
in-game chat is hidden, you can display it by pressing `\`, similar to
pressing `t` or `/` in vanilla Minecraft. Parameters can be passed to
Minescript script commands if the Python script supports command-line
parameters. (See example at [Script input](#script-input) below).

Minescript commands that take a sequence of `X Y Z` parameters can take tilde
syntax to specify locations relative to the local player, e.g. `~ ~ ~` or `~-1
~2 ~-3`. Alternatively, params can be specified as `$x`, `$y`, and `$z` for the
local player’s x, y, or z coordinate, respectively. (`$` syntax is particularly
useful to specify coordinates that don’t appear as 3 consecutive `X Y Z`
coordinates.)

Optional command parameters below are shown in square brackets like this:
[EXAMPLE]. (But leave out the brackets when entering actual commands.)

### General commands

#### ls
*Usage:* `\ls`

List all available Minescript commands, including both Minescript built-in
commands and Python scripts in the **minescript** folder.

#### help
*Usage:* `\help  NAME`

Prints documentation for the given script or command name.

Since: v1.19.2

#### copy
*Usage:* `\copy  X1  Y1  Z1  X2  Y2  Z2  [LABEL] [no_limit]`

Copies blocks within the rectangular box from (X1, Y1, Z1) to (X2, Y2, Z2),
similar to the coordinates passed to the /fill command. LABEL is optional,
allowing a set of blocks to be named.

By default, attempts to copy a region covering more than 1600 chunks are
disallowed. This limit can be relaxed by passing `no_limit`.

See [\paste](#paste).

#### paste
*Usage:* `\paste  X  Y  Z  [LABEL]`

Pastes blocks at location (X, Y, Z) that were previously copied via \copy. When
the optional param LABEL is given, blocks are pasted from the most recent copy
command with the same LABEL given, otherwise blocks are pasted from the most
recent copy command with no label given.

Note that \copy and \paste can be run within different worlds to copy a region
from one world into another.

See [\copy](#copy).

#### jobs
*Usage:* `\jobs`

Lists the currently running Minescript jobs.

#### suspend
*Usage:* `\suspend  [JOB_ID]`

Suspends currently running Minescript job or jobs. If JOB_ID is specified, the
job with that integer ID is suspended. Otherwise, all currently running
Minescript jobs are suspended.

See [\resume](#resume).

#### z
*Usage:* `\z  [JOB_ID]`

Alias for `\suspend`.

#### resume
*Usage:* `\resume  [JOB_ID]`

Resumes currently suspended Minescript job or jobs. If JOB_ID is specified, the
job with that integer ID is resumed if currently suspended. If JOB_ID is not
specified, all currently suspended Minescript jobs are resumed.

See [\suspend](#suspend).

#### killjob
*Usage:* `\killjob  JOB_ID`

Kills the currently running or suspended Minescript job corresponding to
JOB_ID. The special value -1 can be specified to kill all currently running or
suspended Minescript jobs.

#### undo
*Usage:* `\undo`

Undoes all the `/setblock` and `/fill` commands run by the last Minescript
command by restoring the blocks present beforehand. This is useful if a
Minescript command accidentally destroyed a build and you’d like to revert to
the state of your build before the last command. `\undo` can be run multiple
times to undo the build changes from multiple recent Minescript commands.

***Note:*** *Some block state may be lost when undoing a Minescript command, such as
commands specified within command blocks and items in chests.*

### Advanced commands

#### minescript_commands_per_cycle
*Usage:* `\minescript_commands_per_cycle  NUMBER`

Specifies the number of Minescript-generated Minecraft commands to run per
Minescript processing cycle. The higher the number, the faster the script will
run.

***Note:*** *Setting this value too high will make Minecraft less responsive and
possibly crash.*

Default is 15.

#### minescript_ticks_per_cycle
*Usage:* `\minescript_ticks_per_cycle  NUMBER`

Specifies the number of Minecraft game ticks to wait per Minecraft processing
cycle. The lower the number, down to a minimum of 1, the faster the script will
run.

***Note:*** *Setting this value too low will make Minecraft less responsive and
possibly crash.*

Default is 3.

#### minescript_incremental_command_suggestions 
*Usage:* `\minescript_incremental_command_suggestions  BOOL`

Enables or disables printing of incremental command suggestions to the in-game
chat as the user types a Minescript command.

Default is false.

Since: v2.0 (in prior versions, incremental command suggestions were
unconditionally enabled)

## Python API

### Script input

Parameters can be passed from Minecraft as input to a Python script. For
example, consider this Python script located at
`minecraft/minescript/build_fortress.py`:

```
import sys

def BuildFortress(width, height, length):
  ...

width = sys.argv[1]
height = sys.argv[2]
length = sys.argv[3]
# Or more succinctly:
# width, height, length = sys.argv[1:]
BuildFortress(width, height, length)
```

The above script can be run from the Minecraft in-game chat as:

```
\build_fortress 100 50 200
```

That command passes parameters that set `width` to `100`, `height` to `50`, and
`length` to `200`.

### Script output

Minescript Python scripts can write outputs using `sys.stdout` and
`sys.stderr`, or they can use functions defined in `minescript.py` (see
[`echo`](#echo), [`chat`](#chat), and [`execute`](#execute)).  The
`minescript.py` functions are recommended going forward, but output via
`sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are provided for backward compatibility with
earlier versions of Minescript.

Printing to standard output (`sys.stdout`) outputs text to the Minecraft chat
as if entered by the user:

```
# Sends a chat message that's visible to
# all players in the world:
print("hi, friends!")

# Since Minescript v2.0 this can be written as:
import minescript
minescript.chat("hi, friends!")

# Runs a command to set the block under the
# current player to yellow concrete (assuming
# you have permission to run commands):
print("/setblock ~ ~-1 ~ yellow_concrete")

# Since Minescript v2.1 this can be written as:
minescript.execute("/setblock ~ ~-1 ~ yellow_concrete")
```

When a script prints to standard error (`sys.stderr`), the output text is
printed to the Minecraft chat, but is visible only to you:

```
# Prints a message to the in-game chat that's
# visible only to you:
print("Note to self...", file=sys.stderr)

# Since Minescript v2.0 this can be written as:
minescript.echo("Note to self...")
```

### minescript module

User-friendly API for scripts to make function calls into the
Minescript mod.  This module should be imported by other
scripts and not run directly.

#### execute
*Usage:* <code>execute(command: str)</code>

Executes the given command.

If `command` doesn't already start with a slash or backslash, automatically
prepends a slash. Ignores leading and trailing whitespace, and ignores empty

#### BlockPack
BlockPack is an immutable and serializable collection of blocks.

A blockpack can be read from or written to worlds, files, and serialized

orientation of blocks, they can be rotated and offset when read from or
written to worlds.

For a mutable collection of blocks, see [`BlockPacker`](#blockpacker).

Since: v3.0

#### BlockPacker
BlockPacker is a mutable collection of blocks.

Blocks can be added to a blockpacker by calling [`setblock(...)`](#blockpackersetblock), [`fill(...)`](#blockpackerfill),
and/or [`add_blockpack(...)`](#blockpackeradd_blockpack).  To serialize blocks or write them to a world, a
blockpacker can be "packed" by calling pack() to create a compact snapshot of
the blocks contained in the blockpacker in the form of a new BlockPack. A
blockpacker continues to store the same blocks it had before being packed,
and more blocks can be added thereafter.

For a collection of blocks that is immutable and serializable, see [`BlockPack`](#blockpack).

Since: v3.0


#### BlockPacker.\_\_init\_\_
